# Pongame

Yesterday(3/7/2023) I listened to a podcast where Far From Home studio head Andrew Blumenfeld talked about his career. 
Inspired by his words, I decided that I like games, I like everything that happens around games and this is an interesting way to learn and keep me interested. 
I have great graphic skills and want to learn programming at a professional level. 
That's why here on my GitHub I want to update all my further developments in the world of game development and programming.

I wanted to present my first game made 100% from the tutorial from the link below.
Nevertheless, I am proud of myself and feel inspired to do more of this kind of thing
